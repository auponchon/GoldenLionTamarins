PART I : Data correction

sex_check : Subset of GLT with ambiguous sexes for visual inspection
BirthDates : Excel dataframe of known birthdates (created by Valeria)
red_flags_birthdates : Excel dataframe of GLT with erroneous birth dates

* The variable 'BirthError' indicates the type of error we detected:
Multiple_BD = Multiple birth dates
diff_BD_Emig = Difference between emigration date and birth date (ie the GLT was born after emigrating)
diff_BD_1stObs = Difference between the date of first observation and the birth date (ie the GLT was born after first observation)
1stObs_is_BD = The 1st observation equals the birth date
Grp_sameBD = Individuals within groups with same birth dates
Grp_sameBD_?P = Individuals within groups with same birth dates (suspicion of Polygamy)
Adult_with_BD = GLT never observed as juveniles and yet with known birth dates

idade_checks : Excel dataframes of age categories inconsistencies for visual inspection
idade_checked : Excel dataframe of age categories corrected via visual inspection
red_flags_idade : Excel dataframe of GLT with erroneous age categories
* The variable 'IdadeError' indicates the type of error we detected:
Weight : inconsistency between the weight and the age category
Diff_Idade : The multiple age categories (the one in the observation files, and the one we inferred) don't match
Chronology : The age categories chronology are not logical (eg Juvenile-Adult-Subadult)

data_clean_v2 : observation data with birth (BirthOK) and age categories (IdadeOK) corrections and errors


PART II : Data analysis

GS_year.RData = Subset of data for the group dynamics analysis (group size and growth rate). The data com from data_clean_v2 and correspond to the observation data, aggregated by group and by year. The groups have been selected according to the monitoring period (>= 6 years, from 2001 to 2020). "GS" = "Group Size"
GS_frag_year.RData = This dataset has been created by aggregating GS_year at the fragment scale.
